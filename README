django-pygments is a Django app that provides a template tag and 2 filters for doing syntax highlighting with Pygments ( http://pygments.org/ ).

Dependencies:
- pygments
- lxml

Installation:
- add django_pygments to your project directory and to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py
- if you want to see the integrated demo page, add a urls.py entry and copy/link the media files in the proper dir

Usage:
- enclose your code snippet in a pre tag with the non-standard "lang" attribute set to a supported language like this:
  <pre lang="python">....</pre>
- see the view and demo template for examples on how to use the "pygmentify" and "pygmentify_inline" filters (the later is rather useful for RSS feeds) or the "pygment" tag

Notes:
- the custom HTML formatter class displays each line as an ordered list element, thus implementing line numbering without interfering with copy/pasting
- to see a list of supported languages, look at the "lexer_names" variable in utils.py
